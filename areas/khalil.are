#2620
Name A Rocky Path~
Desc A narrow and rocky path twists between larger boulders, leading up a short 
incline. Atop a small mound is a weathered keep with a watchtower, built 
from crudely hewn sandstone. A faded pennant hangs limply atop the 
watchtower, any insignia now bleached away by exposure to the elements. The 
path climbs south and ends at a pair of sturdy wooden doors, the only 
visible entrance to the structure.

#2621
Name Main Hall~
Desc This sizable hall represents most of the space in the keep, with smaller 
rooms to the east and south. The stone walls are partly covered by worn 
tapestries, and solid support beams of dark wood add to the impression of 
security. Except for a small bench along the west wall, the hall is empty.

#2622
Name Base of the Tower~
Desc This room is at the bottom of the watchtower attached to the keep. The main 
hall lies to the east, and cramped barracks are to the south. The walls of 
this room are bare sandstone, with a slate floor. A stone trapdoor with an 
iron ring set in it is close to the west well. Against the north wall is an 
iron ladder, leading up to the watchtower. Since there is no furniture in 
the room, it looks quite bare.

#2623
Name Kitchen~
Desc This room may once have served as a mess hall or a kitchen, though the 
cooking implements look rather primitive. A small firepit against the west 
wall was likely used for cooking. Bare shelves adorn the other walls, and a 
solid but well-scarred table is the only noteworthy piece of furniture in 
the room.

#2624
Name Barracks~
Desc At one time, this room likely held cramped accommodations for a few 
soldiers. Rust marks on the sandstone walls indicate where bunk beds were 
securely attached. However, the bunk beds are not present now - they have 
been replaced with a larger, more comfortable bed. The large bed, unmade, is 
the only item in the room.

#2625
Name Workshop~
Desc This room is a workshop, though it doesn't seem to have seen any use 
recently. A long workbench is against the west wall, with every manner of 
tool present - hammers, chisels, sledges, tongs, files, saws, and so on. 
There is even a light anvil against the south wall, mounted on a stone 
block. Most light repair work on wood, stone or metal could be done here, 
given sufficient time. The tools are not extensive enough to do serious 
smithing or large construction projects, though.

#2626
Name Command Post~
Desc This small but private room once served the commander of the keep. The east 
wall has a tattered and faded map of the surrounding desert posted. An old 
desk is here, stained with ancient ink and spattered with blobs of candle 
wax. A padded chair, clearly much newer, is behind the desk, while a lantern 
provides a warm illumination to the room.

Name Armoury~
Desc Dark, dry and cool this subterranean chamber has an iron ladder against the 
east wall, leading back up to the keep. Hooks and racks line the walls, used 
to store spare weapons and armor for the keep's defenders.

#2628
Name Watchtower~
Desc Above the rest of the keep, this tower chamber has small windows to allow 
the occupants to look out in all directions. An iron ladder on the north 
wall allows both ascent to the tower roof and descent to the base of the 
tower. There are hooks on the walls, but whatever implements they held are 
long since gone. A small table is in the center of this room, with a few 
rickety looking chairs surrounding it.

#2629
Name Top of a Watchtower~
Desc Under the open sky, the roof of the watchtower allows an excellent view of 
the surrounding desert in all directions. Crumbling crenellations reach 
about waist high, and prevent the careless from falling. In the northeast 
corner of the roof, a pennant hangs from a slightly rusted iron pole. The 
banner was once blue, but is too tattered and faded from exposure to bear a 
recognizable emblem.

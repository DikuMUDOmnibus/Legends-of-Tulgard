Name spirit of the shadow kephlen~
ShortD spirit of the shadow of kephlen~
LongD You see the shadow of Kephlen, high General of Bohr, sitting in the throne.~
Desc You look at a shadow, no more than the dark outline of a shadow. However,
looking closer, you notice that you can see him with extradordinary detail,
even though it's pitch dark. Only then, you realize that this being is darker
than darkness itself. He is tall, has very long dark hair, is clad in full
plate armor and bears the ingisnia of the Magi in his chest. You can't make
out his face, but you obviously notice he is Kephlen, High general of the 
forces of Bohr, the magi, because of the amazing similarity in his armor, and
the one you saw two rooms behind, in a great painting on the wall.
All you can see inside of his helmet, are two yellow glowing eyes gazing at
you coldly.

LongD You have awakened the mighty servant to the pharoahs, Ramses.~
Desc As your light spills over his face and body, you can see his features begin
to fill out, swell, and harden, until an apparently healthy man stands before
you, clad only in the raiments he was left in when he last slept.  His hair is
a soft black, his skin a deep chocolate, and his tall frame is totally still, 
his chest not even moving to breathe.

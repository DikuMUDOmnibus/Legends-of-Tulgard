smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window looks out over 
the Felanor River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock and the South

Name Grebe's Tavern~
Desc Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a
dive.  You step carefully over the dead and/or drunk sailors
on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

Name Andy's Pub~
Desc The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people
are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East
of you is another section of the pub.  You know that there are rooms to
be had somewhere around here...

Name A Room in the Pub~
Desc This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this
prosperous establishment.

Name The Bar~
Desc A long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.  Mugs line a shelf
behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most
inviting glances your way.
A sign is on the wall.

Name The Inn~
Desc You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a ``homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.

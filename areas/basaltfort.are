Name Before the Basalt Fortress~
Desc Large columns of flame rage all around you in this fiery inferno.  The
path you are on seems to be rather safe from the lava flows that bubble up
from the smoldering grounds.  The air here is thick with the scent of
brimstone and sulfur, adding to the difficulty of breathing the hot air.  To
your south stands a mighty fortress formed from the basalt that has cooled
enough to be worked with tools.  The clang of weapons and shouts of fighting
can be heard as well as the screeches of children playing.  To the north
leads back into the mountains.

Name Mess Hall~
Desc This area has many dinning tables set up for the duergar who come here to
eat and socialize.  It is very tidy here, not one thing seems to be out of
place or dirty.  The smell of roasted meats lingers in the air.  The mess
hall continues to the west, and an exit heads east to the duergar Market.  To
the east is a door.

the east wall are racks of spices and utensils, all kept orderly and labled.

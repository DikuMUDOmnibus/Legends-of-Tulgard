Desc A tendril of the root dead ends here due to a small cave in of dirt and 
rocks. The dirt is becoming muddy due to the amount of water seeping through 
the ground. Small bugs crawl deep into the soil as they dig out new homes. A 
small mineral deposit glints at the end of the root.

Name Before a Hazy Outline~
Desc As you are placed gently upon the ground by the bird, the thick silver fog 
cloaks you. The land  is hushed in a kind of reverence. No birds can be 
heard chirping, and the wind carries only its  own wuthering. Reaching out 
through the fog you find your path clear. A hazy outline of a tree is  
before you. The tree appears to be the only creature in the area besides 
yourself.

Name Short Marble Hall~
Desc You pass through the trunk of the tree into an unexpected marble hallway. 
The apparition of the tree trunk closes soundlessly behind you. Testing the 
see through wall reveals you can easily slide your hands through the 
barrier. Although the hall is enclosed, wind wuthers through the entire 
length. Runes are marked on the walls. This is obviously a sacred place.

Name Before a Golden Door~
Desc The marbled hall ends here, and a wide golden door before you pulses with a 
glow. Looking at the  door is almost painful as the gold shines clearly. A 
simple iron knob allows the door to be  opened. There is no lock. Your hand 
is oddly steady as you reach for the knob, as if you know what rests on the 
other side means you no harm.

Name Into the Wind and Starlight~
Desc You emerge in a world that is at a constant twilight. Silver flecks of 
stardust swirl around the  nebulous clouds in the darkened sky. Golden 
colors stream through the air. A warm, soft wind swirls around you as the 
golden door closes. Arcane runes made with onyx pebbles weigh down the green 
grass. A large altar is at the top of the grassy hill. A robed avian stands 
at the altar with his head bowed in prayer.

Name A Stretch Of Tunnel~
Desc This narrow stretch of tunnel connects to the main tunnel network to the 
northeast, and to unknown parts heading southwest.  Small piles of tiny 
objects lie here, more than likely pillaged from someone who carelessly left 
them about.

Name The Bend~
Desc The bend in the tunnel extends somewhat northeast, with a path tracing back 
to the west. Quite unlike the tunnel section to the northeast, it has an odd 
shape to it, as if something not so skilled at digging was doing the work.

Name The Dog Leg~
Desc This stretch of tunnel fans that out east and west is well constructed, and 
able to take plenty of abuse and travel by those that inhabit the tunnel 
network. Various small bugs can be heard slowly shifting through the tunnel 
at all hours of night, and day.

Name A Connecting Root~
Desc A few cheerful sunbeams are visible. This root must lead above ground 
somewhere. You have traveled for many miles underground and wonder where you 
will be let out. The sunlight is a welcome relief for your strained eyes. 
You can again hear birds chirping in the distant, and the underground 
creatures crawl back into the deep root system to escape the light.

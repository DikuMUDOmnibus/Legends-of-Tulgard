Desc This angelic woman is somewhat tall, standing at approximately six feet in 
height. She appears slender, with a toned and athletic frame. Her skin is 
tanned to a warm golden bronze, yet appears soft and smooth. Her eyes are, 
when open, a deep ocean blue, and almost seem to glitter with a defiant 
inner light. Her wavy silver hair extends to her shoulders, the almost 
metallic strands shimmering as they catch the light with every movement. A 
few wisps of hair hides her ears, yet there is no mistaking the elfin 
features of her finely boned face, from her high cheekbones and delicately 
arched eyebrows, to her narrow jawline and soft, pink lips. Delicate wings 
extend gracefully from her back, closely resembling the wings of a bird of 
prey. The soft white feathers seem to give off a bright pearly sheen in the 
light.

The massive spear before you gleams wickedly in your hands. You can't seem 
to let go..nor even turn your eyes away from it. The weapon itself is made 
out of the vile Hardakin and is darker then even the black flames that 
consume it. It is devoid of all things holy and pure. The Spear hungers for 
nothing but death.. it's voice haunts you..calling your name seductively. It 
drains away any thought from your mind save the need to kill. You can feel 
it drawing upon your life force. It thirsts for the blood of the holy. 
Nothing else can satisfy it's unquenchable hunger. `1 `1 A closer look upon the massive blade of the spear as you momentarily break 
from it's trance and `#`SYour Name appears Engraved upon It in Blood`^, just 
another soul waiting to be claimed through death by the Gentle Lord..

ExtraDesc black claymore thunder haze sword ~
The mighty ethereal blade before you hums chaotically. The sword itself was 
born from the cries and wails of both grief and despair caused by the 
suffering of the innocents. The blade itself is erratic. It never sits in 
one place as it hums quietly to itself. It flickers with the lesser 
movements of your hand.. and wails it's screams, writhing about it's 
somewhat translucent sword-form with dynamic movements. It's pommel is red 
velvet laced with golden etchings. Upon it is a garnet amulet of a 
serpentine dragon devouring itself in agony. `1 `1 The Blade whispers with the soft voice of a sobbing mother: `1 `rI `Sa`ym t`Yhe S`ywo`Srd t`rh`Sa`yt s`Yt`yo`Sps `rt`She `rT`Sy`yr`Yan`yt`Ss a`rn`Sd p`yr`Yot`yec`St`rs `St`yh`Se `rI`Sn`yn`Yoce`yn`St.`^ `1 `1

early beginings. He was a paladin and loving husband to Lady Soryalis. He 
was a defender of Seandac.. and like all Seandacians, he wished only to 
slaughter the wicked... which is what he did.. He waged war.. His mighty 
Spear gleamed with his inner power and thus, the beginings of the Spear 
emerged.... `1 `1 The Statue on the northwestern portion of the room glows, awaiting to be

Name the inner sanctum~
Desc The voice continues... Hardakin loved how quickly his enemies fell. He was 
the Gentle lord.. bringing forth a quick and easy death to all his foes. In 
time.. he knew his superiority in battle far outmatched the skills of his 
wife. He began to treat her like a lesser. All the while, his lust for death 
consumed his soul. He became a killer. A dark warrior. He stopped at nothing 
for his selfish goals and destroyed everything in his way.. Yes.. He even 
fought his wife.. that nuisance of a woman.. She tried to no avail.. `1 `1 A monument of the battles on the northeastern wall slowly beckons to you.

Name the inner sanctum~
Desc Hardakin fought his wife. They battled everywhere and anywhere. His chaotic 
whims brought him power where her code of honor could never satisfy. He 
brought death.. even if at every turn he faced the Lady Soryalis. It 
mattered not.. countless died regardless.. Until one day.. the Haze rose up 
like a rising storm built from the cries of anguish and despair.. placing 
Hardakin to sleep. Venture forth and test your might. Test to see if you are 
worth awakening Hardakin. `1 `1 A black gate glows eerily behind you to the south.

ExtraDesc statue ~
The statue in the middle of the fountain is of a regal half-elven woman and 
two bears.  The two bears are a mother and her baby.  The woman wears a 
flowing gown with a cloak about her body that billows behind her, a sword 
sheathed at her side, and she is barefoot.  Her face is gentile and her eyes 
sparkle with red rubies.  She leans slightly down, her hand out touching the 
mother bear as the baby is up on its hind legs, reaching out to the woman's 
hands, playing with her.  They stand upon flat stones, as if in a shallow 
river, to which the fountain water trickles through and into the base of the 
fountain bowl.  Carved into the fountain is an enscription: 'Ohri Nightmoon, 
ranger of old and protector of nature.'

#64100
Name Before the Palace~
Desc To the north the majestic stone gates to the palace lay open. More symbolic 
than utilitarian, the sheer mass of the gates would easily take a small army 
of men to close much less open. To the south, a miniature replica of the 
palace gates opens to the temple of Graal. To the east and west of this 
cobbled area the districts of metal and silk meet the district of flames.

Desc Cobblestones continue unabated in multiple directions from here. To the west 
of this intersection the southern entrance to the Palace is visible and the 
area here is visibly muted for it. To the north, gardens and stalls of 
flowers dominate the path. To the south, the faint sound of hymns being sung 
echoes through the area.

the south temple chimes whistle gently in the wind. To the northwest and 
west roads curve away with the celestial sound of voices in song echoing 
down them and into the heavens.

#64105
Name Anshio Exit Gate~
Desc To the south droves of people scramble to be the first out of a small 
doublewide gate. Craftsmen with barren carts and full carts alike squabble 
over who will be first for what reason as children rush around them. The 
gate in question is a large one with heavy black oak door and porticullis 
set into the large stone wall that seperates the city from outsiders.

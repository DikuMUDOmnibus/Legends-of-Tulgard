Name A Buried Courtyard~
Desc What once might have been a lovely courtyard has been buried by a cave-in 
and rubble from above. Cobblestones shattered by the age old destruction 
form an uneven walkway to the east and west away. A defunct fountain crowns 
the courtyard in its macabre glory.

Name A Child's Playroom~
Desc The only room in a peasant house to survive, this small space has been 
lovelingly covered in small trinkets. In one corner pebbles of odd colors 
have been painstakingly stacked. In a small pile a few steps away, scraps of 
crumbling parchment covered with beautiful flowing script covers the floor. 
A small doll has been pinned to the wall by a stake.

Name A Spotless Salle~
Desc The rubble has been cleared from every inch of this space within a large 
rectangle. A makeshift set of racks has been constructed with wooden 
shrapnel on one of the few remaining walls of what must have been a huge 
estate. Sand trickles down the blood red stone cave walls slowly on the east 
side.

#12894
Name A Hidden Nook~
Desc Hidden by the warped floorboards of the room above, a small lockable pantry 
occupies this space. While the supplies are long since gone, someone has 
obviously put the space to good use storing other things here. Wooden 
shelves surround the small space giving large amounts of room for any 
goodies brought down.

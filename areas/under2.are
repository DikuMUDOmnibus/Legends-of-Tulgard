Name Corner of Wyrm Street and Sunset~
Desc You stand in the north western corner of the Underdark.  The bustling 
streets sound distant and the hum of people moving and talking barely 
reaches your ears.  The only light in this section of the city comes from 
your light source.  You stands against the huge cavern's walls.  Water 
glints in the light on the walls.  Wyrm Street goes east, and Sunset goes 
south.

muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear. You can hear the

the east and north of you. You light doesn't even illuminate up to the ceiling.
Darkness surrounds you. The ground is hard and grey. The walls are grey, and

Desc Moonlight avenue is a boring street.  Nothing exciting happens here, you
wonder if it is the name.  The street is clean and well travelled.  You seem
oddly at ease on this street.  The shadows seem less dangerous here.  The
light of the floating orbs is unsure and insecure, they seem to flicker in and
out. Moonlight Avenues goes north and south, to the east is Diamond street.

Desc As you walk deeper into the city, you realise that this city is huge and
therefore confusing.  It's seems lawless, but then you see a floating eye
teleport a person to their jails.  You wonder what laws a city like this has,
then you see a person in a fight being taken away also.  Maybe there are rules 
after all... To the north is Emerald street, Slaver's goes east and west.

huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people. but also agonized screams.  The shadows seems to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world. Nothing can stop 
it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make a difference? For a 
moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the darkside" you feel empty 
and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill threatens to overcome your entire 
being. The gathering place continues north and west.  To the south lies the

that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to        
be blessed indeed.

mq5 say I knew of such a sword once..long since forgotten..
mq7 emote drifts off, deep in thought.
mq13 say I recall a section of tunnel..guarded by unseen forces.  That is where you may wish to start
exploring, keep in mind that things are not always what they appear to be, young traveller.
mq15 emote mutters, whispering 'Where did I place that serpent trinket?' ever so softly.
mq17 say Ahh, well.. that is about it for now, unless you have anything else to discuss. I wish you the best in your travels.

Name demon rosaline taint ghost~
ShortD the taint of Rosaline~
LongD This large female ghost glares at you, and suddenly you want to return home to mommy.~
Desc A demonic woman is here with long, flowing raven-black hair. Her hair 
cascades down her back in soft waves, shimmering with health in the light. 
Set upon her face are two almond shaped eyes, a nicely set nose and sly 
looking lips. Her face is setup softly with her high cheekbones, making it 
quite easy on the eyes.  Her lips are a fierce blood red, her eyes lined in 
black, defining them both in a complimenting way. When seen within her mouth 
are fanged humanoid teeth. Within her eyes are two orbs of a greenish yellow 
hue, standing out even more so with the black liner. Making her eyes almost 
glow like greenish fire. They glow eerily and even as shadows pass over 
them, their brilliance never falters or fades. Her bodily frame is dainty, 
but still looks like it could handle a great deal of physical wear.  She is 
slightly muscular but only in a complimenting way.  Her body is pieced 
together generously with a supple torso, a slim waist and lusciously rounded 
hips.  Her strong thighs help keep her posture elegant and graceful in all 
she does. Behind her trails a very long, prehensile tail.  She only stands 
at about 5'5''. Upon her back are massive raven-feathered wings. Spread 
completely, each wing has a span of 18 ft. and remains glossy as a raven or 
crow's with good health.

Name In the Catacombs~
Desc The walls drip with water that has accumulated from the moisture in the air. 
Age old skeletons hang from the walls and litter the floor. Various arcaic 
designs have been etched into the brick in the walls. You can see a small 
stream of water running down towards the center of the catacombs. A torch 
barely hangs from the wall. The torch gives a soft glow about the room. It's 
very dark, and you wonder the when the last time you saw the light of day 
was.

ExtraDesc sign~
The sign reads:
         This is a bottomless pit cleverly disguised as a well.  People have
fallen in and never been heard from again.  Trust me, you don't want to go 
down there.

#4143
Name The top of the mountain~
Desc You are standing at the top of the mountain.  It feels more like the top of
the world.  To your north lies a huge platinum door.  You hear very pronounced
grumbling from behind the doors.  It sounds like something huge and hungry.
But if you don't have the key you don't have to worry because you can't get in.
If you do have the key I would suggest not going in.  Some believe the Five
Headed dragon Tiamat was imprisoned here by the gods.  But who believes in 
fairy tales.  Well, if you're scared, you can always go down the mountain.

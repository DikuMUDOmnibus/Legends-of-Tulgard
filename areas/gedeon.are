Name The Entrance Hall~
Desc You stand in the entrance hall to a grand mansion.  A plush carpet, moldy 
and worn with age, rests beneath your feet.  Despite the wear, an outline of 
an ancient family crest is still discernable upon the carpet.  A matching 
crest, a great dragon resting upon a glimmering altar, is carved upon the 
double oak doors leading to the mansion's interior.

Name The Grand Hall~
Desc It is obvious that this room once acted as the grand entrance hall for a 
very well to do family.  Spacious and wide, the walls stretch high above you 
meeting in a large dome above your head.  A grand mural depicting the night 
sky has been painted upon the dome giving the room a dismal impression of 
eternal midnight.  Despite years of neglect the furnishings within this room 
still bear testimony to the wealth and prestige that must have marked this 
abode.

Name The East Wing~
Desc A dim light seeps into this hallway from large ornate windows that overlook 
the central courtyard.  The light seems dull and grey, having filtered 
through the dirty windows, and does little to fend away the darkness and 
gloom.  An eerie chill breeze blows through this corridor rustling cobwebs 
and playing with the heavy drapes of the windows.  The corridor continues to 
the north and back to the Grand Hall.  A set of double doors leads to a room 
to the east.

and darkness.  A strong stench of decay dominates the hall.  You can faintly 
see a large oak door to the west.  It is almost completely obscured by thick 
cobwebs as though it has not been opened in ages.  Another set of double 
doors leads to the north.

Desc This was once an exquisite banquet hall for holding grand parties.  Yet 
years of neglect have left this hall in a sad state.  The walls and floors 
have been masterfully crafted from polished white marble which is now just a 
cracked dirty dull grey.  A black ivy has grown within the room, clinging to 
the walls and crawling along the floor like snakes.  Heavy drapes shut out 
any of the light that may have once graced this room through grand floor to 
ceiling windows.  The hall continues to the east and a small oak door can be 
seen to the north.

Name The Ballroom~
Desc Ages ago happy couples would dance and frolic within this hall laughing in 
merriment.  Now this is just a hall of sorrow and gloom.  Large floor to 
ceiling windows have been heavily draped, shutting out all outside light, 
swallowing the entire hall in one deep ominous shadow.  The shadow seems 
alive, moaning and weeping in sorrow.  The only light in the room filters in 
from a large hole in the ceiling where years ago the roof had collapsed 
above this hall.  The walls, floor and ceiling are almost completely covered 
with a clinging black ivy.

Name The Kitchen~
Desc Entering this room a spicy rich aroma assails your nostrils.  At first whiff 
it is mouth wateringly sweet, as if some master chef were preparing a great 
roast.  Yet a keen nose soon sniffs a feint underlying scent of decay, as 
though the meat had gone rancid and sour.  The source of the aroma is a 
mystery, for no fires are lit for cooking.  Nor does it appear that anything 
has been prepared in this kitchen in decades.  Mold and cobwebs cover the 
oak pantries and countertops.  There is a small trapdoor in the far corner.

Name The Library~
Desc This room once served as the focal point for knowledge and study in this 
manor.  After ages of neglect and indifference this library has fallen into 
a wretched state.  Numerous oak bookshelves, filled to capacity with ancient 
and obscure texts, line the finely carved wooden walls of this room.  Great 
and invaluable works of intellect, long believed lost or destroyed, rest 
forgotten upon the shelves.  A solid wooden door leads back to the west 
wing.

Name The Trophy Room~
Desc A tribute to manliness, this room is dedicated to conquest and triumph.  
Everywhere you see marvelous trophies marking a great hunter and swordsman.  
Spectacular and horrible creatures, many of which are completely unfamiliar, 
have been mounted throughout the room.  In each of the four corners of this 
room stands a different warrior statue wearing full battle regalia and 
wielding strange and exotic weapons.  An eerie purple fire burns within a 
large fireplace.  The flames cast strange flickering light throughout the 
room and the affect is to give the figures within an ominous vitality.  A 
wooden door leads south.

A plush golden carpet spans the length of the entire floor.  The room is 
full of different gaming pieces and sporting items including a complete 
Orcish Mulletball set.  There is a striking grandfather clock against the 
northern wall.

Name The Shrine~
Desc `sAs you enter this unholy shrine a chilling sense of unease grips you.
Lesser men would flee from this room screaming in terror.  This is an
abominable place where the vilest acts of perversion and decadence are
performed in homage to the dark gods.  The walls, floor and ceiling have 
been covered with arcane runes painted in blood.  An obscene mural has been 
painted upon the entire western wall.  It is a horrible painting of demons 
raping and torturing young girls in a foul orgy of sacrifice to the black 
deities.`^

Name The Parlor~
Desc This room is large and spacious.  The entire northern wall consists of 
enormous floor to ceiling windows, each 15 feet in height.  They have been 
heavily draped with thick black curtains that block all outside light.  
Black and white marble tiles make up an enormous checker board pattern upon 
the floor.  A small glass door leads south and another oak door leads to the 
east.  A large winding staircase curves around the room, ascending to the 
second floor.

Name The Gallery~
Desc This is the gallery where the portraits of the great lords and ladies of 
this manor would be proudly displayed.  However, the atmosphere permeating 
throughout this room is one of mourning rather than pride.  The room is 
totally dark and the portraits have all been covered with moldy white 
sheets.  There is a door leading south and another larger oak door 
leading west.

Name The Courtyard~
Desc `sThe air in this courtyard is heavy with the scent of decay and burning 
leaves.  It is not an unpleasant odor though.  Rather, within this courtyard 
it seems quite fitting and oddly comforting.  A gnarly black ivy has almost 
completely overrun the courtyard.  The ivy is thick and clinging, seeming to 
entwine itself around your feet as though it wished to ensnare and bind you.

Name The Wine Cellar~
Desc A strange `ggreen`^ moss grows upon the stone walls and floor of this room.  It 
glows, shedding a feint eerie green light throughout the room.  The air is 
thick with the musty smell of rotting leaves.  There are some boxes piled to 
the ceiling along the far wall.  An old wooden ladder leads to a trapdoor in 
the ceiling.

Name The Master Bedroom~
Desc This room is exquisitely decorated and well kept.  The furniture is 
obviously of the finest elven craftsmanship.  A plush purple carpet spans 
the entire floor.  Matching drapes of purple cover the windows blocking any 
outside light from entering.  The air is richly perfumed but with a faint 
underlying scent of decay.  An eerie green fire burns within a small 
fireplace along the southern wall.

Name The Dungeon~
Desc This room is dark and damp and altogether unpleasant.  The walls and floor 
are made from a cold grey slate.  Shackles have been mounted to the walls 
and a few sets of chains dangle from the ceiling.  In spots you can see dark 
red stains spotted along the walls and along the floor.  The shadows in this 
room seem unnaturally dark and foreboding.

Name The Yard~
Desc `sIt's as though the autumn twilight never lifts in this yard.  It is 
overgrown and very unkept.  The yard is surrounded by a forest of giant 
trees that stand cheerless and dejected.  The leaves are eternally sad 
shades of grey and brown.  You can see movements within the trees, quick
and darting.  To the south a door leads into the manor.

I with borrowed silver shine,
What you see is none of mine.
First I show you but a quarter,
 Like the bow that guards the Tartar;
 Then the half, and then the whole,
Ever dancing round the pole;
And true it is, I chiefly owe My beauty to the shades below.

Name `1 `^`rThe Museum`^~
Desc `^`ST`^`whe Foyer and main hall to the huge and eerily lit tower seems to be an odd 
mix of a library and freakish museum. Prominent in the room are the stuffed 
bodies of some of the more interesting and lesser known creatures in 
Arthos.. From a dissected Thri-Kreen to a Sahuagin warrior. Each are stuffed 
and mounted behind polished steel and wood; with a plaque under each exhibit 
listing a small history of the race. Books of the history of the world and 
the dieties are littered about the room; stacked on tables, chairs, and even 
some parts of the soft black carpeted floor. Giant Black marble columns with 
golden veins spiral upwards towards the ceiling at every corner of the 
triangular shaped tower`^`S.`^

Name `1 `^`r Summoning Room`^~
Desc `^`ST`^`whe summoning room is a large spherical room carved from what appears to be 
one giant white marble stone. The walls, the floor, and the gold and silver 
inlaid symbols in the black tile floor all appear to be flawless; as if 
crafted by some powerful magic. A giant dias of obsidion rests in the very 
center of the room; surrounded by perfectly crafted, small arcane runes of 
binding and holding. Whatever is summoned here, it seems the master of the 
binding and holding. A giant ebony axe has been embedded into the floor into 
floor in the center most room; destroying the largest rune`^`S.`^

Desc `^`ST`^`whe sound of rushing water greets your ears as you enter the large, oval 
shaped, scrying room. The floor seems to be on a constant slope downwards, 
leading into a small pit in the center of the room that overlooks a large 
pool of water. Surrounding the pool of water are a few comfortable pillows 
lined out in a semi circle; so one could easily stare into the pool of water 
for hours in relative comfort`^`S.`^

while others are more arcane. The maps line the sides of the room, covering 
the dark and gloomy onyx walls and making this room one of the more pleasant 
in the otherwise loathesome Onyx Tower. Small candles seem to burn by 
magical means upon the desks in the large room; flames constantly flicking 
and dancing upon their wicks to play dancing shadows on the walls`^`S.`^`

Desc `#`SQ`^`wuite and serene, the bedroom of the master of the Tower radiates with a great feel of peace and relaxation. A large dresser made from ebony sits at the corner of this octagonal shaped room. Each of the dressers are adorned with six white and red candles that have long ago melted down into pools of hardened wax. The center of the bedroom raises gently on a platform dais, upon which a giant harem of exotic pillows and silken blankets serve as a sleeping area. A large boxed off sand garden is situated in each corners of the room, which appears to have been raked over with the long willow reed sitting beside them. The walls are covered in large murals that depict the deep swamps in the southern lands of Arthos`^`S.`^

tapestries line the walls going up the stairway; Every other tapestry 
depicting a red and brown eye, or a giant white King Cobra. Large 
crystalized skulls of Trolls have been set on pedestals at each corner of 
the spiraling staircase, and a window that looks out over the frozen 
mountains that the tower is situated on. The air becomes harder to breath as 
the elevation rises with the tower, the chill almost painfull`^`S.`^

A giant fiery red diamond that flickers with a dark aura of evil, sits on large dais. Surrounding the room are giant animal totems that face towards the center of the room, the snake totem closest to the center. The dark marble floor is covered in a thin layer of dust, and spiderwebs around the diamond on the dais, showing that no one has been in this room for ages. A great sense of power emminates from this room, strengthening and fortifying the already almost impenetrable walls tower. Off in the corner, strangely enough, a ebony crib rests close to the ground almost out of site`^`S.`^

forever. The ceiling is lined with hundreds of powerful runes of binding and 
holding, preventing the use of magical escape while the thick wooden and 
iron doors prevent any means of physical escape. Cages and torture devices 
line the sides of the room for unruly prisoners; while the inside of the 
dungeon has been carved out into a fighting pit, and filled with thousands 
of snakes`^`S.`^

Desc `^`SB`^`wefore you, carved from the peaks of one of the icy mountains, looms a dark 
onyx tower spiralling upwards into the clouds themselves. Giant and twisted 
cyprus trees cling to the rock and melting snow of the moutain, surrounding 
the monsterous tower and bathing the enterance in shadows. Other then the 
sound of the harsh winds that wear the tower smooth, naught but a disturbing 
silence can be heard near the large tower. The few animals that can survive 
in the harsh enviroment of the snowy mountains can be neither seen nor heard 
near the tower`^`S.`^

Steel racks line the walls holding glimmering weapons from Angelic blades to gigantic pole arms. Tomes and books detailing the arcane line a small corner in burnt crisps, while they are replaced with dozens of priceless jewels and gems on the tables set around the room`^`S.`^

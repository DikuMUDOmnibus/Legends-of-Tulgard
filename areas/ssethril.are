Desc A giagantic male dragon towers towards the skies here, standing at nearly 
fourty feet. His dark obsidian wings stretch outwards and appear as if their 
tips could reach up and touch the clouds themselves if he so willed it. His 
dark reptillian eyeballs are the size of a humans hand; both of the large 
black orbs burning with an inner flame of sinister intent. Across his 
muscular back, shoulders, and head are large ivory horns that look as if 
they could easily impale a smaller being.

I with borrowed silver shine,
What you see is none of mine.
First I show you but a quarter,
 Like the bow that guards the Tartar;
 Then the half, and then the whole,
Ever dancing round the pole;
And true it is, I chiefly owe My beauty to the shades below.

Desc `^`ST`^`whe Foyer and main hall to the huge and eerily lit tower seems to be an odd 
mix of a library and freakish museum. Prominent in the room are the stuffed 
bodies of some of the more interesting and lesser known creatures in 
Arthos.. From a dissected Thri-Kreen to a Sahuagin warrior. Each are stuffed 
and mounted behind polished steel and wood; with a plaque under each exhibit 
listing a small history of the race. Books of the history of the world and 
the dieties are littered about the room; stacked on tables, chairs, and even 
some parts of the soft black carpeted floor. Giant Black marble columns with 
golden veins spiral upwards towards the ceiling at every corner of the 
triangular shaped tower`^`S.`^

Desc `^`ST`^`whe summoning room is a large spherical room carved from what appears to be one giant white marble stone. The walls, the floor, and the gold and silver inlaid symbols in the black tile floor all appear to be flawless; as if crafted by some powerful magic. A giant dais of obsidion rests in the very center of the room; surrounded by perfectly crafted, small arcane runes of magic enhancment. Recently though, it seems a giant obsidian axe has been has been slammed into the center of the dais; destroying the central and most powerful ruin in a attempt to hinder the magic in this room, rather then enhance it`^`S.`^

leading into a small pit in the center of the room that overlooks a large 
pool of water. Surrounding the pool of water are a few comfortable pillows 
lined out in a semi circle; so one could easily stare into the pool of water 
for hours in relative comfort`^`S.`^

magical means upon the desks in the large room; flames constantly flicking 
and dancing upon their wicks to play dancing shadows on the walls`^`S.`^`

great feel of peace and relaxation. A large dresser made from ebony sits at 
the corner of this octagonal shaped room. Each of the dressers are adorned 
with six white and red candles that have long ago melted down into pools of 
hardened wax. The center of the bedroom raises gently on a platform dais, 
upon which a giant harem of exotic pillows and silken blankets serve as a 
sleeping area. A large boxed off sand garden is situated in each corners of 
the room, which appears to have been raked over with the long willow reed 
sitting beside them. The walls are covered in large murals that depict the 
deep swamps in the southern lands of Arthos`^`S.`^

depicting a red and brown eye, or a giant white King Cobra. Large 
crystalized skulls of Trolls have been set on pedestals at each corner of 
the spiraling staircase, and a window that looks out over the frozen 
mountains that the tower is situated on. The air becomes harder to breath as 
the elevation rises with the tower, the chill almost painfull`^`S.`^

diamond that flickers with a dark aura of evil, sits on large dais. 
Surrounding the room are giant animal totems that face towards the center of 
the room, the snake totem closest to the center. The dark marble floor is 
covered in a thin layer of dust, and spiderwebs around the diamond on the 
dais, showing that no one has been in this room for ages. A great sense of 
power emminates from this room, strengthening and fortifying the already 
almost impenetrable walls tower. Off in the corner, strangely enough, a 
ebony crib rests close to the ground almost out of site`^`S.`^

holding, preventing the use of magical escape while the thick wooden and 
iron doors prevent any means of physical escape. Cages and torture devices 
line the sides of the room for unruly prisoners; while the inside of the

onyx tower spiralling upwards into the clouds themselves. Giant and twisted 
cyprus trees cling to the rock and melting snow of the moutain, surrounding 
the monsterous tower and bathing the enterance in shadows. Other then the 
sound of the harsh winds that wear the tower smooth, naught but a disturbing 
silence can be heard near the large tower. The few animals that can survive 
in the harsh enviroment of the snowy mountains can be neither seen nor heard 
near the tower`^`S.`^

are replaced with dozens of priceless jewels and gems on the tables set 
around the room`^`S.`^

Desc This is the entry foyer of this home.  Rooms branch off to the west, east 
and north.  A door to the outside is to the south.  Atrap door rests in the 
floor, a railing extending above it, leading to the staircase that allows 
access to the area below.  The entirety of this rooms wall space is covered 
in one solid mural, depicting a beautiful forest.  Pillars rest in the 
corners and the center of the walls.  Even the ceiling has been painted to 
look like the sky.  A few small skylights provide light, along with several 
candle holders mounted to the pillars.  Only the floor is left unpainted, 
its natural wood boards oddly fitting.

Desc This well-made wooden platform is seemingly designed for the inhabitants of 
the attached home to enjoy the peaceful outdoors without the inconveniences 
of insects or poor weather.  The near floor-to-ceiling windows are enclosed

bugs out.  Several layers of such material cover the exit to the west to 
keep bugs out but still allow passage of the home's owners.  This deck

ones to the south, this one is about three feet tall, and appears to 
actually extend below the surface of the deck to allow for more room for the 
roots of the tree here.  Other than the plants here and a lone bench, there

boards, covered in a layer of soil and small, rounded stones about an inch 
thick.  The edges of the pond are lined with piles of flat stones to hide 
the wooden walls that hold the water in.  The water itself here is about 
three feet deep, and somehow is always maintained at a very comfortable 
temperature.  The water continues north, west, and northwest, while the dock 
is to the south.

While it is impossible for others to see in, passengers can see out as 
though there were nothing between them. The spells creating the effect keep 
the weather out, too.

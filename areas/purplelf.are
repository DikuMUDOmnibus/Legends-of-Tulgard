Name wench~
ShortD wench~
LongD The waitress, Wench, leans over and asks you for your order.~
Desc Sexy doesn't begin to describe Wench.  The only one who knows this
fantastic feline's real name is Jorinth, and by the glint in his eyes, he's
not telling.  When Wench moves, eyes turn.  The tail swishes behind her
gracefully, and her hips sway in an opposite direction.  Her white fur is so
thin that you barely notice it, and her hair is so full that it covers most
of the two pointed ears at the top of her head.  She is exotic, and many
proposition her.  Few get the answer they desire.

Name Jorinth Durendal, the Proprietor~

LongD Jorinth grants you the crooked smile of a rogueish proprietor.~
Desc White hair and pale, almost colorless blue eyes dazzle you with his
obvious sense of humor.  He looks you, grins, and is full of energy, but
something in his eyes speaks of secrets and age.  Nobody can tell how old
Jorinth is, but they all have rumors.  He wears a teal tunic with a black
belt, and a thin silver chain.  Flipping the glasses (and liquor) is a
specialty of his, and he never spills.  He's a clown, a barkeep, and a
friend for all.

crossed over his chest, and his left arm lies limp by his side.  He looks
you, and is dressed in a sort of harlequin's outfit which lends him a comic
look.  He's so peaceful the way he is, that you wonder if you should - or

Name Spectral Woodcutter~
ShortD a spectral woodcutter~
LongD The spectral woodcutter turns his axe on you as you approach.~
Desc This lumberjack got stuck in the forest when the tragic crack of the
Heart of Stone happened.  Bit by bit it seeped his life away until all
that's left is what you see.  He's large, bearded, angry, and curiously
bereft of clear thought.  He stumbles toward you with no aim or purpose. 
He's evil and undead, true.  But you can't but help pity him before you
realize it's fight or flee.

Desc Haul away, haul away, Joe.  This "Joe" is no small man, as you can tell
by the muscles that bulge when he lifts the nets full of fis.  His scraggly
beard seems to fit his image, the way a slinking walk does a seductress's
life.  He whistles when he works, and calls to his "mateys" never seeming
down, never seeming upset - except when he's had too much rum, and feels
like a fight.

This gown is gorgeous and expensive.  The forest green material hangs
over the hoop in soft pleats, rippling down until it reaches the floor.  The
bottom hem is gathered in even areas, pinned to the higher portion of the
skirt by golden brooches.  The front part of the dress parts to show the
under-skirt, which is a soft black and gold hatch-pattern.  This pattern and
material is used for the front portion of the bodice, and on the inside of
the sleeves, which hang down to the mid-thigh.  The rest of the bodice is
snugly fit around the torso, tied tightly in the back by gold and black
laces.  The puffed sleeves are echoed by a high back collar which rolls
softly at the top of the neck, just below the cranium.  The front neckline
is boxed, and pushes the breasts up to enhance the cleavage..  The hem of
the bodice is a layer of boxed greens over boxed black and gold, offset
half-way so they both show simultaneously.  All trim is in black and gold,
to finish the complete look of this very rich Lady's Gown.

Desc This courtyard is made of close-fitting stones which have been smoothed
and cleaned to a brilliant white.  Several trees line the courtyard, some
recognizable, some not.  One tree possesses a golden-hued trunk, and leaves
that you'd swear were carved of emeralds.  This tree stands to the west,
leading towards Tethyr Pass.  To your north, you see the Purple Elf Tavern
and Inn, but oddly, you hear no sounds coming from the building.  To your
east, you hear the sounds of the ocean in the distance.

discover to be filled with life.  Musicians singing on and around the stage
to the west, a sleepy customer coming down the east stairs, and the barkeep
getting a message from the kitchen behind the bar.  Everywhere you go are
tables and people of all races imaginable, and some you've never believed
could be.  Just as you regain control of your senses, you find yourself led
to a table, and abandoned there.

top to bottom.  Against the stone sleeps a man, dressed in a Harlequin's

standing behind that is the nastiest, coldest, most mysterious man you've
ever seen.  But then, you don't see much of him.  His eyes are shadowed by
the flat hat he wears, his clothes are all black, save a teal belt, and a
silver chain, and he's half-way hidden by the desk.  Not much else is in the
room, but you feel a thousand eyes measuring you up and down.  You see doors
around you, you think.  They all seem hazy against the walls, however, so it
might be a good idea to "feel" your way.

Desc This room is decorated in a brownish-yellow hue with deep rust accents. 
Those who stay here have money, though no titles.  The bed is a comfortable
creation of down and straw, and has several layers of soft blankets.  The
dresser lines the opposite wall with a mirror hung above it.  There's an
elegant throw-rug on the floor with images of men in a marketplace, selling
their wares and becoming richer.

ExtraDesc bed~
The bed is comfortable, but not so comfortable as to make you desire to
remain in it forever.  In fact, it makes you think of how much more
comfortable you'd be in the Noble's Bedroom.  And to do that, you need more
money.  Which is why you'd want to sell things.  Ah, the glorious life of a
merchant!  
~
ExtraDesc mirror~
The glass of this mirror is tinged a bit on the yellow side, and swells
in a way that gives you a thinner, more flattering appearance.  Your
reflection smiles back at you, almost as if it knows everything you do. 
Which it does.  
~
ExtraDesc rug~
The rug is beautiful, woven with intricate skill by loving hands.  The
greens and the blues of the noble lady's dresses enliven the scene, as do
the bright smiles of the wealthy merchants.  If you look really closely,
though, you manage to glimpse a dark figure removing a coin or two from the
rear pouch of a merchant.

Desc Every luxury is within this room.  The coloring is in regal hues of deep
purple, from the satin sheets to the plush carpeting.  The furniture's of a
light wood, trimmed and decorated with the same hue of deep purple, and some
gold leaf.  The chandelier that brightens the room sends patterns to
interlock with the filigree on the posts of the canopy bed, and the rope
that dangles beside that bed is decorated with a gold thread.  Everything
you see in this room bespeaks of great wealth and pampering.

scattered on the floor.  Several hooks hang from the ceiling, and from
those, hung by loops, are every type of feather imaginable from all around
the world.  Some you recognize, some you don't, but all, you would suspect,
would tickle you past the point of tears.  There are also stocks in here, to
put people while they're being tickled.  It's all-in-all an innocent, silly
way to pass the time, but there's no accounting for taste.  Or style,
either.

Name Carytyr Lane~
Desc The road is soppy as you get to the last stretch before the stream. 
Ahead of you, to the north, you see a bridge crossing that stream.  To your
left is the Guard house.  You sense the end of the city upon you, and scent
the fragrance of a fresh-cut field before you.

Name Guard House~
Desc House?  More like a box.  The guard waits inside and around this box,
often mumbling something about "Kah-fei."  A candle is the only light
within, and again you see a small pair of eyes, tinier this time.  It's
probably a mouse.

Name Forest of Rhythym~
Desc You are entering the legendary Forest of Rhythym.  Within these woods it
is said the "Heart of Stone" is hidden.  This Heart is cherished as the
origin of all beat, all rhythym.  It's been carefully guarded since the
Rift, for fear that all Rhythym would end should it break.  This includes
the rhythym of breathing, heartbeats, and of walking.  Long ago, another
legend tells, there was a great fire in a city outside of Antyr.  This City
no longer exists, but the survivors, men known as "The Knights of Revels"
escaped.  Many fought when they discovered there was a ruse, and that it was
arson, save one.  That one retained his power long enough to find the Heart
of Stone - cracked.  In trying to fix it, he fell into a deep sleep.  That
Legend says the last Knight of Revels, Corwyn Tormyr, waits somewhere in
this forest for the next generation of heros to wake him, and help him heal
the forest.  All in all, though, the Forest seems a silent, spooky place.

Name The dark woods~
Desc You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night.  The trees above 
block all light and wind.  The air is stagnant and smells of death and 
decay.  The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and 
you feel very much like turning back and heading for safer areas.  The path 
leads north into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness 
of the forest.  A small sign is posted here.

Name The dark woods~
Desc You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest.  Huge skeletal trees 
line the edges of the path and tower above you.  Errant rays of light spear 
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light 
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.  
The path winds north and south into darkness.

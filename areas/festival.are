due how closely they were planted together. Far off in the distance you can 
hear people talking about who will finish the maze first. Every once in a 
while you hear people calling out for help inside the maze. There seems to 
be no prize for finishing it.

Name End of the Corn Maze~
Desc The maze opens up to a small cleared area. You have finally come to the end 
of the corn maze. Spectators are waiting here and cheering your arrival. A 
small water fountain has been placed here for the weary ones that have run 
the maze. A pebbled pathway trails off to the side. It looks like it leads 
back to the playground.

mob echoat $n Suddenly the surrounds become black, the feeling of twisted and pulled stronger than ever.
mob echoat $n With a bright flash of white light, the sensation is gone and the world begins to reappear.
mob echoaround $n As $n passes through the energy field, $s body distorts and suddenly vanishes.

This fruit is large enough to fit neatly in the palm of a hand, its surface

tightly packed clusters of dark red, translucent seeds, each with a 
creamy-yellow kernel in the center. The seeds are extremely juicy and 
somewhat tart, their taut surface and the interior kernel also making them 
rather crunchy. The juice of the seeds tends to stain fingers and clothing a

oranges and yellows. Encircling the patio are a number of small citrus 
trees, causing the scent of oranges, lemons and limes to lightly scent the 
area. The small structure to the north has been incorporated into the garden 
wall, and a lively-looking musician with pipes has been painted to either 
side of the entryway.

among the leafy foliage. The golden-brown adobe wall of the garden rises up

the deep green leaves, and finally to the reddish soil.

a hidden spot within the trees, its music mingling with the soft murmur of 
the channels.

waggle in the breeze, and shake each time a lizard leaps from one shaft to 
another. The air is cool here, as if finely misted water is trapped by the 
lush growth of reeds.

Name A Channel with a Clump of Cattails~
Desc A thick clump of slender reeds grows along the edge of the channel here, 
with thick stalks supporting fuzzy-looking, dark brown ovals above the pale 
green leaves. Tiny fish dart back and forth among the cattails, rippling the 
surface of the water with their motion. A snow-white ibis stalks the fish, 
its long, curved red beak occasionally piercing the water.

three-lobed leaves rustling softly in the breeze. On the other are a number 
of smaller trees with glossy, dark green leaves, each bearing bumpy, nearly 
black avacados. The garden wall here forms the front wall of a small 
compound, and has been painted with murals of children at play.

Desc Cacti of all shapes grow here, their spiny forms kept carefully away from 
both the pathway through the garden and the snowy white pavillion set here. 
Each clump of cacti is a different hue, and many bear blossoms that have 
attracted the occasional honeybee. Patches of `#`Mbeavertail`^ cacti, `#`Ygolden 
barrel`^ cacti, `#`ss`wi`Wlv`we`sr `Wcholla`^, and `#`sfishhook`^ cacti thrive here, offering a 
sharp contrast with the golden-brown sand.

not a hint of the flesh is revealed, the snowy white of the plant stark 
against the desert sand.

with the leaves in color if not in texture. The arbor was built tall enough 
for most adults to stand beneath it, and the thick covering of vegetation 
provides deep shade. A few mats of woven reeds have been set near the wall, 
at the edge of the arbor, where someone has obviously sought a refuge from 
the rays of the sun.

shrubs in ornate clay pots are set at the base of each column, while 
climbing vines speckled with tiny, fragrant white blossoms cover trellises 
set between each column. A narrow staircase spirals up into the ceiling at 
the southeast corner of the space, while several folding screens demarcate

vines that seem to flow up the wall and across the arbor, where tendrils of 
grape vines curl around those of the passion fruit vines growing to the

Name A Cool, Dry Room~
Desc There are several rows of storage bins in this room, which hangs heavy with 
the scent of foodstuffs. Shelves line one wall, stacked with jars, pots and 
sacks, and a small desk has been placed in the corner beside the shelves. 
The air is still and dry, as well as much cooler than the weather outside.

Name A Cool Meditation Room~
Desc Set into the earth, this room is cool both by day and night. The walls have 
been whitewashed and then painted with a mottled yellow and cream wash. 
Lanterns flicker against the walls and ceiling, and both reed mats and thick 
cushions have been placed upon the floor.

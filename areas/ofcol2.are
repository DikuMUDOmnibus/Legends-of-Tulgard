descendent of a surviving cityguard of old Thalos.  He believes that everything
has to be hard won to be kept, and that laxity is for the weak.

Jacklyn is a mage and a warrior makes her the perfect captain of the citadel
guards.  Jacklyn is very beautiful, but whether it is due to her pale softness
or her magic, no one has ever found out.  She isn't very strong physically, but
she need not be.

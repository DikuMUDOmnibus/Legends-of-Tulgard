Name Healing Pools~
Desc You enter a room which is the first in a tower built in the name of the 
Goddess Venalena.  The fragrance of the healing pools overwhelms you, the 
smell of the calming salts beginning to relax your senses and clear your 
mind.  The walls are made of light grey stone and are decorated with 
tapestries of various beautiful landscapes.  Placed on the walls at various 
places are torches to light the room.  To the left is a what seems to be a 
natural `#`Shot spring`^ mixed with the calming salts that assaulted your senses.  
It looks very inviting.  To the right is another inground pool, its waters 
cooler than the other, used to `#`Srinse`^ off the salts.  Set between them in the 
centre of the room is a long wooden bench.

may be used to bridge the gap of minds. To do so, all one must do is share 
them with each other and each allow the blood of our people to touch your 
skin. As a gift of love.. they may only be used willingly. The curse of the 
sands upon those who'd seek to escape this edict.

Name Before the Labyrinth~
Desc All around you are the tall grasses and thickets that grow rampantly upon 
the plains of Mithas.  A short distance west, however, there appears to be a 
rather large rock outcropping.  Around it's base, the rock rises almost 
completely vertical for a hundred feet before rounding off.  At the highest 
point the hillock must reach about three hundred feet.  A small, dark cavern 
entrance can be seen in the distance to the west.

Name The Labyrinth~
Desc This room contains hundreds of skeletons of various creatures.  Most of the 
bones resemble humanoid races, but there are some exceptions.  The giant 
skeletal head of a dragon stares at you with it's lower jaw dislocated and 
hanging from only one joint.  Another pile of bones once belonged to 
something which possessed four arms and six legs.  It seems as if this was 
the end of the road for many who chose the wrong path.

Name Palace Garden~
Desc Breath-taking beauty is the only way to describe the garden that surrounds 
you. Various exotic plants and flowers are the home to butterflies and other

Name Palace Garden~
Desc Roses, pansies, daisies and other colorful flowers adorn the ground in this 
part of the garden. A sweet smell greets you as a soft wind gently blows 
through, giving the area a serene, quiet feel. Right in the center of the 
flowers stands a large fountain, spraying water into the air.

Name Palace Garden~
Desc The grass grows quite long in this area, showing perhaps a slight lack of 
concern for this area. A fence stands at the back part of the garden. Even 
it seems to be adorned as vines creep in and out of the holes between fence 
pieces. Various statues seem to guard the fence, each small and intricately 
crafted. A gate lies to the east of here.

garden. A small bricked trail leads east into the palace. A place for the 
gatherers' muddied boots is placed inconspicuously next to the door.

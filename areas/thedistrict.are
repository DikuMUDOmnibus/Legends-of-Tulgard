Name jean claude~
ShortD `#`wJean Claude`^~
LongD `#`sJean Claude `wstands here in his `Wwhite frilly `wshirt.`^~
Desc He moves like a dancer, or a cat, a smooth, gliding walk. Energy and grace 
contained, waiting to explode into violence. He's not that tall, maybe 
five-eleven. His hair is perfectly black, curling softly around his face. 
His eyes, if you dare to look into them, are a blue so dark they are almost 
black. Like glittering, dark jewels. The only thing that mars the perfection 
of his body is a dark cross-shaped scar on his chest. If you could bottle 
Jean-Claude's laugh it would be fattening. Or orgasmic.

Name asher~
ShortD `#`wAsher`^~
LongD `#`sAsher `wstands here looking regal.`^~
Desc . Asher is a blue-eyed blond, but that description doesn't do him justice. 
The waves of his shoulder-length hair is golden. Not blond, but gold. His 
hair is almost metallic in its glittering brilliance. He eyes are a blue so 
pale, they are almost white, like the eyes of a husky. Half of Asher's face 
is the beauty that drew a master vampire to him centuries ago. The other 
half is covered in scars. Holy water scars. The scars start about an inch 
from the midline of his face so his eyes, nose, and those full, perfect lips 
remained untouched, but the rest was like melted wax.

face, maybe longer than waist-length. His eyes are the color of lilacs, a 
wonderful pale lavender that is a genuine show-stopper. Nathaniel manages to 
be childlike, catlike, and still be an adult. You don't know whether to pat 
him on the head, rub his belly, or kiss him.

Name Lunatic Cafe~
Desc The Lunatic Cafe is owned by Raina and located in University City. Its sign 
is a glowing crescent moon with the restaurant name done in soft blue neon. 
There is a bar along one wall, polished dark wood, old and lovingly cared 
for. The rest of the room has small, round tables that could comfortably 
seat about four. Great place to meet lycanthropes.

Name Church of Eternal Life~
Desc At the Church of Eternal Life they promise just what the name says, eternal 
life. And they can prove it. No leap of faith. No waiting around. No 
questions left unanswered. How does it feel to be dead? Just ask a fellow 
vampire church member! The Church is run by Master vampire Malcolm and 
located far from the District. The Church doesn't like to be associated with 
the riffraff. They think of themselves as mainstream undead. They recruit by 
going door to door, like the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses. A sign on 
the door reads, "Enter Friend and be at Peace."

Name Burnt Offerings~
Desc Burnt Offerings is a bar and restaurant located far from the vampire 
district. The waiters are either real vamps or just wannabes. As you walk 
through the door there is a poster from 1970's movie Burnt Offerings. There 
is a life size waxwork of Christopher Lee as Dracula in the bar. There is 
one wall with framed caricatures of horror stars of the sixties and 
seventies. It isn't uncommon to see clusters of visitors trying to identify 
who is who. At midnight whoever has the most correct guesses gets a free 
dinner for two. Try the Bela Lugosi burger while you're there - extra rare 
unless otherwise requested!

Name Old Abandoned Hospital~
Desc All vampire victims are taken to the basement of the old St. Louis City 
Hospital. The hospital was closed down but the morgue stayed open because 
they couldn't afford to move the vampire room. It's a special vault room 
with a steel reinforced everything and crosses laid on the outside of the 
door. There's even a feeding tank to take the edge off that first blood 
lust. Rats, rabbits, guinea pigs. Just a snack to calm the newly risen. 
 
There is a set of stairs leading down here.

Name Circus of the Damned~
Desc The Circus of the Damned is housed in an old warehouse. Its name is emblazoned across the roof in colored lights. Giant clown figurines dance around the words. If you look very closely at the clowns, you notice they have fangs.
The sides of the building are strung with huge plastic banners. One banner shows a man being hung. Zombies crawl from a graveyard in another picture. A very bad drawing shows a man halfway between wolf and man shape. None of the banners look very wholesome.

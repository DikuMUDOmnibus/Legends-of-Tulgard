#ROOMS
#10550
Name The Entry Room~
Desc This is a large room with a coat rack, a shoe rack, and a big comfortable 
couch. The floor is highly polished hardwood and the couch is situated with 
its back pressed against the east wall. As soon as you walk in you see the 
shoe rack right beside the door with a sign on it that says "Remove shoes 
before entry." A few paces east is the coat rack which is almost in the 
corner, and a bit north of that is the couch. The walls are decorated with 
multiple portraits (mostly of lizardmen), torches, and two windows near the 
door.

large one at the eastern end and 3 smaller chairs on the western end, and a

there.

likely so that the cigar fumes can not leave the room.

fireplace on the western side of the room which is beautiful...but there

man.  The great Lich King..  Companion to the Demon Empress.  The throne
appears to be made of skulls, bones and other such rotting material and
fossilized to remain solid.  The armrests are made of various skulls both
fanged, sharp-toothed and deranged.

Name Front Gate~
Desc Right before you is a giant gate carved into the likeness of a giant,
deformed and demonic skull.  A lazy haze slowly escapes the great mouth of
the skull.  It blocks all sort of scanning ahead..  Making it impossible to
know just what exactly is there.  On either side of the path stands two
statues of demonic serpents.  Their eyes are inset with rubies that seem to
glow eerily.
